# hello-world
First tutorial project on GitHub
My name is Drusko (for now) and I am very keen to learn how to code and especially utilize GitHub once I am quite proficent with coding. I am looking forward to be creative with my coding skills as I believe coding is one platform that is very versatile to express my creativity.
